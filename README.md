# Student Manager

This project is a simple console-based Student Management System built using the C programming language. It allows for basic operations such as:

- Adding student records
- Deleting students by ID
- Searching for a student by ID
- Displaying all students belonging to a specific class

The system uses a singly linked list to dynamically manage student records in memory. Each student is represented by a struct that stores details such as their ID, name, age, gender, and class number.

## Components of the Project

The whole project contains features as follows:

1. Add Student: Adds a new student to the beginning of the list with provided details.
2. Delete Student: Deletes a student based on their ID. If the ID doesn't exist, it notifies the user.
3. Search Student: Finds and displays a student record by ID if it exists.
4. Display by Class: Lists all students who belong to a given class, showing their ID, name, age, and gender.

To run the program simply open a terminal and run the following program:

```bash
student_manager.exe
```
